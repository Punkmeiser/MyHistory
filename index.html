            <p><span class ="line-height">The prime of game consoles was now. 
            I had grew up with consoles like the PS2, Wii, gamecube, and Xbox 360. I had played a variety of games from Super Smash Bros, GTA 4, Dragon Ball Tenkaichi, and Jak and Dexter. Not only were consoles a main form of entertainment, but I had
            learned to play yugioh at which I had been frustrated at my brother for winning too much so I usually gave a tantrum.
          My mother also had a tutoring buisness where I was aquaintanced with many new people. I also was aquaintanced with a best friend, Adam while being babysat at a neighbor's house.
        There were other mediums of entertainment from watching the Saturday cartoons which I would remember Sonic and Dragonball Z Kai verison to watching shows near 6pm like Family Guy, the Simpsons, and Two and a Half Men.</span></p>
        <br>
        <p><span class ="line-height">Early hobbies had devolped in this time too. We had a piano at home so I would play it constantly when I was bored. I had to go with my brother on Sunday's for his piano class I had wanted to piano classes.
          I was denied to take classes by my parents since I think I was too young. I had also tried out a Shaolin class, but also denied by my parents even though I wanted to take the lessons.
        </span></p>
        <br>
        <p><span class ="line-height">
          At this time I had to go to my grandma's Vietnamese Catholic church in which I had to be sit there for an eternium. Everything was in Vietnamese so I did not know what they were talking about and did not believe in it.
          However, I also went to the Buddhist temple in which I had to sit there for an eternium as well, but it was a mix of people so they had to speak in english for some of it. There I understood the basic principles of there religon,
          so I really cared about the religon.
        </span></p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p><span class ="line-height">
            There was also a traumatic incident with a dog. My brother ocasionally had played basket ball in the middle of the street with some neighbors while I watched. I heard some people playing and walked outside while my parents were watching a show.
            I went outside and I saw nothing, but I still heard people playing. I located the sounds to my neighbor's backyard. I was looking through my neighbor's fences to see what was happening. Then a dog had seen me and had escaped from the fence and began chasing me.
            I was able to get near my house's mailbox, but the dog had caught up to me and I was full of bites on my stomach and leg. From that, I was scared of dogs and ever adopting one.

            <p><span class ="line-height">My mother's tutoring buisness had siphoned its way into debt so my mother closed, but had hosted the buisness at home. She had middle school - highschool students there so it was a bit roudy.
              When my mother had tutoring at home from 3 - 5pm she had made me study as well with math and english packets. I had hated it so I mostly just hid them so I could avoid them. I was sensitive at the time at the tutoring buisness where
              there were middle school students beating me in games, especially Halo Reach in which I usually had raged and turned off the console.

            </span></p>
            <br>
            <p><span class ="line-height">
              During school I had to participate in ELA for a semester since I wasn't very good in English as for an english comprehension test I had rhymed the word "walk" with "pea".
              There I learned random things such as rhyming. I was also a loner and remember crying because I was bored and had nothing to do. I had known aquaintances, but I hadn't really hanged out with anyone
              since I didn't have a common intrest with anyone while people were playing basketball or being on the playground. Then I was introduced to a small group with like 2 girls and one boy in which really opened me up to meeting new people.
              After school though I had become great friends with Adam and his brother Miles at my neighbor's babysitting buisness. I think my days were split between my mother's tutoring buisness and going to my babysitter even though my mom was home.
              It was free since she said I was keeping Adam and Miles busy since they usually argued at each other or were bored.

              Now I was able to take classes for piano and Shaolin. Since I had a passion for piano, I thought I would do great. However, I had to go through the basics where I had become tired of those practice books/mini pieces. In Shaolin, it was grueling
              for me and I had become very tired after class.

            <p><span class ="line-height">I had got my first portable device between my brother and I. It was an Ipad which I had experienced the internet more. I had been given my brother's laptop
              which I had not used that much since it was slow. I also was given my first allowance which was quite high per week being 7yrs old as I coerced my father when my brother had also been given an allowance.
              While being a child, I had been frugal with my money since I had nothing to buy except for stuff like candy or lunch at the cafeteria. My mother had also stopped making me homemade lunch and I had switched to cafeteria food.
              At the time had been just eating lots of Vietnamese food and now I had been eating lots of carbs and new items. I had gained lots of weight and continued to eat carbs.
            </span></p>
            <br>
              <p><span class ="line-height">During this time my grandfather had died. My brother, mother, and I had ocasionally visited him nearing his death. I had not known him that much so I did not really have any emotions.
                However he wanted to be buried where he was from so we had buried him at the Mekong River close to Vietnam's borders. My mother's side was really large as well as my father's so they had the whole family go to Vietnam
                to host the funeral. This would be my first vacation where we actually went places. We took residence in our uncle's mansion at the time while we explored Vietnam. We had gone to the temple half the time while the other half was
                meeting a lot of my family. I had met my grand-uncle who was the twin of my grandpa so I was shocked of how similar he looked to my grandpa. I would also see my cousins who were 20 - 30 smoking clouds
                of different shapes and drinking a lot. I remember the mansion had six floors with housemaids and a dog which would bark at everyone. Since I was scared of dogs since the incident when I was five. 
                While at the temple, I had learned about the religous people's lives which seemed very strict. I remember my mom said I should go jokingly, but I took it serious and had threw a tantrum whenever she had mentioned me going there.

            <p><span class ="line-height">Now I was in uppergrade; not much had happened except for more interaction with fellow classmates. I had also joined the San Jose Youth Symphony Percussion Ensemble. I met with a new best friend, Justin,
              which we had done many of the worst things I regret. I felt this era of my life was the most eventful socially with my friend Justin. While Adam was hanging out with new people, I had found Justin who was a new student from Florida. 
              I had become mean and started cussing in 6th grade, to match Justin's dialect from Florida.
            </span></p>
            <p><span class ="line-height">
              At this time as well, my mother stopped tutoring and found found a job that required her to be at work 7am - 5pm. There wasn't much interaction at home after school, so I was estatic and not be forced to study from 3 - 5pm now.
              </span></p>
            <br>
            <p><span class ="line-height">At the end of Elementary school, I had friends with many new people, while having a great teacher who gave lots of group work. I also began a youtube channel
              which I have done some embarrasing videos. I stopped uploading on that channel after a year, but kept everyhthing up for the history. Even if I wanted to private those videos, I have 2 step verification
              on my account and have lost my phone number so I cannot access my account.
            </span></p>
            <br>
            <p><span class ="line-height"> I also started being more immersed into technology and started my technological adventure.
              I started to program python and learn about the basics of Python. I wasn't really able to do anything with it, but I felt closer to learning about 
              how things work.

            <p><span class ="line-height">
              I also had another vacation as my brother, mother, and I had gone to Los Angeles by bus as my brother wanted to go to an Anime convention. I only wanted to go to get out of San Jose and experience the hotel experience.
              So I had stayed inside the hotel most of the time except for going to a One Punch Man concert and waiting in lines for stuff that was too expensive.

          <div class="timeline__event-descr">
            <p><span class ="line-height">This was now middle school and had an even larger social experience. 
              At the begining of 7th grade the 6th grade boys of my class would meet there at break which I would be apart of it.
              As people grew apart, my best friend at the time, Justin, had started to avoid me and never talk to me ever again so I had to meet new people.
              My personality really changed to being friendly and cringey to being more edgey and distanced from people in 7th grade.
              I observed as my old friends, Philip and Nathan were hanging out with Justin as well. I knew Justin was going to distance himself from them as well so as soon as I realized he left the group,
              I swooped in and rekindled my relation with Philip and Nathan. I became best friends with Nathan as our personalities grew off each other to be more edgey.
              The group grew over my middle school years and Adam had come back. He asked why me and Nathan changed so much in our personalities and adopted a more edgey stance
              so he could rekindle his relation with us as well. The group also grew as I invited some introverted friends who invited there introverted friends so it became large in introverts.
              Even though it was introverted, it was still normal and not as obnoxious as it is today.
            </span></p>
            <br>
            <p><span class ="line-height">The classes during middle school however felt less difficult then the time I commited in 6th grade. There was still a lot of group work,
              so I was able to meet a lot of new people. I was friendly with a lot of them so they knew who I was, but not really friends with them.
            </span></p>
            <br>
            <p><span class ="line-height">
              At this time, I was really hyped about my future and wanted to drastically change my life. I kept planning for my life with drastically different paths. I had started watching self improvement videos
              like for studying and sleeping, but I had usually quit my goals after a day or sometimes a week if I could handle it. Each time I kept changing it like sleeping from 12 - 4AM everyday which I had tried to do for 2 months.
              To this day, I still try to change my life, but slowly so I don't overstress myself and quit.
            </span></p>
            <br>
            <p><span class ="line-height">
              Wanting to change my life, I volunteered my 8th grade summer to teaching kids html and css. Even though I knew nothing about html and css, I was very commited to the program and doing many extra stuff.
              I knew nothing about html and css, but was able to figure it out in a day. However, I was really bad at teaching and public speaking so after my teaching expierence I knew I had to develop these skills more.

            <p><span class ="line-height">While in Freshman, I had met lots of people, and had lots of experiences. I met a new great friend, Nathaniel, which I talk daily today during art class and shown me an oppurtunity to 
              skip math 2 and 3 to get where I am now. Before freshman, I wanted to skip Math 1, but was unable to since my parents said not to skip classes. After I had gone through Math 1 and whined about how easy it was, they were
              convinced that I could do Math 2 and 3. It was hard to skip two classes in a row, but I got through to Calculus now. I also illegally invested into Tesla and AMD as I saw tesla drop to 180$ when I bought, and AMD was at 20$,
              however I felt guilty so I had to sell my shares before they could ever grow.

            <br>
            <p><span class ="line-height">However in Sophmore year, I didn't meet as many people and had just did the same thing every day. It felt repetitve since my classes were too easy.
              I met a great group of people, since my original group I hanged out with was becoming more obnoxious and weird. Since classes were easy, I had decided to learn more about IT. In the past I had dabled with servers
              and created a minecraft server for my friends. My friend and myself created a decent minecraft server since I was bored and gotten me even more into IT. However
              that server needed constant maintenance and I was learning about new things in IT so I gave the server's ownership to my friend. I felt behind as I heard students going to a programming class last year, 
              I had enrolled the EVC's CS075 class in the summer to improve my programming foundations. In the past I had just enough to create small scripts, but now I feel confident with foundations to create small applications. It had improved
              my understanding of object oriented programming. Now I need to catch up with my IT studies since I had to ignore while I was in my summer class.

            <p><span class ="line-height"> I was able to go to Japan in October and mostly just wanted the hotel experience. I had cut ties with Japanese media since I was in 7th grade since I did not want to associate with weeaboos at the time so I avoided tourist
              attractions about Japanese media.
              I just wanted to experience what it was like to live in Japan so I did not want to luxurize my experience there. I had enjoyed the magnetic trains, 7/11, and laundrymats for everyday life. I became very frugal there and eventually had to
              spend the rest of my money at the end. So I had bought some expensive pens and some souvenirs for myself. However, I bought lots of Japanese candy to bring home. The pictures of the project's background are pictures from Japan.

            <p><span class ="line-height"> Now in my Junior year, I feel very stressed now since I am worried about a lot of my classes. With distance learning it feels even harder to learn since I am constantly distracted 
              by being online on my computer. During this time, I hope to improve myself through time management even though I have been trying for the past 5 years.

      <p class = "center">Before writing this, I believed I haven't had much to share, but now after writing all of this before editing this. I have seen there has been a lot of stories and lots more that I have not talked about. Analyzing the first part of my life,
        I was a lot more sensitive, but I had grew out to become a more distanced an insensitive person throughout the years. Now I am trying to become a better person by combining my two sides together. My spending habits over the years have declined and 
        even had to overdraft due to my bad investing actions. Now I try to not act on my monetary impulses and think about the future terms.
